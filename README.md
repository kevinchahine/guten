# guten
Named after Johannes Gutenberg the inventor of the printing press, guten is a text-based user interface library used to create elaborate visual output on a terminal/console. Used much like a GUI library to make visual displays on a command line. Create charts, graphs, tables and game boards in color with ease. Makes unicode characters like lines and blocks easier to use and combine. Great on systems that don't support graphical displays like servers and some Raspberry Pi systems or when you want an easy way to output more than just letters to a terminal. Uses much less system resources than a GUI would but still provides nice visual output. See Wiki: https://github.com/kevinchahine/guten/wiki for examples. Currently only supports ascii and utf-8 character sets and color on windows and linux. Future development may support utf-16.
